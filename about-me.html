                            <p>Building this "professional" portfolio has shown me how hard it is to display who you are to people who may not really know you in a professional yet authentic way. 
                                While my technical skills and knowledge are mainly highlighted, 
                                I want you to know there's more to me. 
                                
                                <br><br>
                            I consider my ability to connect with people as my superpower. Whether it's being the team's 
                                source of humor or the go-to person for solving complex problems, my interpersonal skills are what make my 
                                technical skills shine brighter. From a young age, I was the kid who never missed a chance to talk, often noted 
                                on my report cards with a "needs improvement in verbal self-control." Over time, I've channeled this energy 
                                into a powerful tool.
                                <br><br>
                            I strive to grow and learn from every experience, aiming to become a better professional, family member, 
                                and friend. Here are some highlights of my personal attributes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Engaging communicator with an innate ability to connect</li>
                            <li>Brings humor and positivity to anything possible</li>
                            <li>Effective in persuasion and negotiation</li>
                            <li>Loves working with and being around others</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Beyond my professional life, I'm passionate about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spending time with family and friends is #1</li>
                            <li>Going to games for the Chicago Bears, White Sox, and Iowa Hawkeyes</li>
                            <li>Staying active and healthy by working out and playing sports</li>
                            <li>Cooking and, of course, eating</li>
                            <li>Keeping up the news in global events, sports, and tech</li>
                            <li>Going to concerts and discovering new music</li>
                            <li>Traveling to new places</li>
                            <li>Rewatching my favorite episodes of Suits and The Sopranos</li>
                            <li>Reading articles and journals (still working on the books part)</li>
                            <li>Picking up new hobbies to keep life exciting and challenging</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>My journey is just beginning, and I'm grateful for all of the people I have in my life: my immediate and extended family, friends, roommates, current/former classmates, teachers and employers, and everyone I will meet along the way. I am trying to enjoy my time before I enter "the real world" but I am even more pumped to continue growing both personally and professionally.</p>
