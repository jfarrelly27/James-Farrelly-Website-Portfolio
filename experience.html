                            At Impact Advisors, I had the opportunity to work in both the Strategy and Operations practice as well as the healthcare technology practice. For my capstone project, I undertook data analysis, research, and engaged with hospital executives to strategize a successful merger. In every week during July, I traveled to a healthcare system in Orlando and analyzed data on over 15,000 surgeries to optimize surgery turnover times, maximize resource utilization, and increase revenue potential. Additionally, I played a crucial role in supporting the deployment of a cloud-based ERP system at Seattle Children's Hospital.
