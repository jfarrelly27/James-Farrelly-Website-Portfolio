                            I am set to begin my journey with Ernst & Young as a Technology Risk Consultant in August 2024. 
                            In this role, I look forward to collaborating with a dynamic team to assess technology risks 
                            and develop strategic solutions to mitigate potential threats. I will focus on 
                            maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information assets, 
                            aiding clients in navigating the complexities of technology and its associated risks. 
                            This position offers an exciting chance to apply my analytical skills and grow my knowledge in 
                            risk assessment at a renowned Big Four firm.

                            At Impact Advisors, I had the opportunity to work in both the Strategy and Operations 
                            practice as well as the healthcare technology practice. 
                            For my capstone project, I undertook data analysis, research, and engaged with 
                            hospital executives to strategize a potential merger. 
                            Every week during July, I traveled to a healthcare client in Orlando and analyzed data on over 
                            15,000 surgeries to optimize surgery turnover times, maximize resource utilization, and increase 
                            revenue potential. Additionally, I played a crucial role in supporting the deployment of a 
                            cloud-based ERP system at Seattle Children's Hospital.
